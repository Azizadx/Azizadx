# 💫 About Me:
🌟 Hello there, I'm Nasrallah Hassan, but you can call me Azizadx! and I'm excited to welcome you to the world of decentralized magic! 🪄

🪄 As a blockchain sorcerer, I'm currently enchanting Solidity and Ethereum with my coding spells, crafting smart contracts that will change the world. 🔭


When I'm not working on blockchain, you can find me coding backend or building something crazy on the side. I like to keep things interesting! 😎💻


My fascination with Zero-Knowledge Proof has led me down a new path of discovery. I'm eager to learn more and share my knowledge with others. 🕵️‍♀️🔐


I'm currently improving my data structures and algorithms skills while learning smart contract auditing. 💻🔍


Currently seeking a mentor to guide me in mastering the art of Rust and the Solana blockchain. Who wants to take on an apprentice? 🧙‍♀️


Don't hesitate to ask me anything about the mysteries of the decentralized world. I'm happy to share my wisdom and knowledge of blockchain with those who seek it. 💬


Let's create some magic together! 🎉 You can reach me at azizadx.tech@gmail.com for collaboration or just to say hello.
